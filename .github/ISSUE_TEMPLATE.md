Please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect. If you have a general question, please try using [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/tags/c/general/17/ggally) first.

Please include a minimal reprex. The goal of a reprex is to make it as easy as possible for me to recreate your problem so that I can fix it. If you've never heard of a reprex before, start by reading <https://github.com/jennybc/reprex#what-is-a-reprex>, and follow the advice further down the page. Do NOT include session info unless it's explicitly asked for, or you've used `reprex::reprex(..., si = TRUE)` to hide it away.

Delete these instructions once you have read them.
