\usage{
ggcorr(data, method = c("pairwise", "pearson"), cor_matrix = NULL,
  nbreaks = NULL, digits = 2, name = "", geom = "tile", min_size = 2,
  max_size = 6, label = FALSE, label_alpha = FALSE,
  label_color = "black", label_round = 1, drop = FALSE, low = "#3B9AB2",
  mid = "#EEEEEE", high = "#F21A00", midpoint = 0, palette = NULL,
  limits = TRUE, legend.position = "right", legend.size = 9, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame or matrix containing numeric (continuous) data. If
any of the columns contain non-numeric data, they will be dropped with a
warning.}

\item{method}{a vector of two character strings. The first value gives the
method for computing covariances in the presence of missing values, and must
be (an abbreviation of) one of \code{"everything"}, \code{"all.obs"},
\code{"complete.obs"}, \code{"na.or.complete"} or
\code{"pairwise.complete.obs"}. The second value gives the type of
correlation coefficient to compute, and must be one of \code{"pearson"},
\code{"kendall"} or \code{"spearman"}.
See \code{\link[stats]{cor}} for details.
Defaults to \code{c("pairwise", "pearson")}.}

\item{cor_matrix}{the named correlation matrix to use for calculations.
Defaults to the correlation matrix of \code{data} when \code{data} is
supplied.}

\item{nbreaks}{the number of breaks to apply to the correlation coefficients.
Defaults to \code{NULL} (no breaks, continuous scaling).}

\item{digits}{the number of digits to show in the breaks of the correlation
coefficients: see \code{\link[base]{cut}} for details.
Defaults to \code{2}.}

\item{name}{a character string for the legend that shows the colors of the
correlation coefficients.
Defaults to \code{""} (no legend name).}

\item{geom}{the geom object to use. Accepts either \code{"tile"},
\code{"circle"}, \code{"text"} or \code{"blank"}.}

\item{min_size}{when \code{geom} has been set to \code{"circle"}, the minimum
size of the circles.
Defaults to \code{2}.}

\item{max_size}{when \code{geom} has been set to \code{"circle"}, the maximum
size of the circles.
Defaults to \code{6}.}

\item{label}{whether to add correlation coefficients to the plot.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{label_alpha}{whether to make the correlation coefficients increasingly
transparent as they come close to 0. Also accepts any numeric value between
\code{0} and \code{1}, in which case the level of transparency is set to that
fixed value.
Defaults to \code{FALSE} (no transparency).}

\item{label_color}{the color of the correlation coefficients.
Defaults to \code{"grey75"}.}

\item{label_round}{the decimal rounding of the correlation coefficients.
Defaults to \code{1}.}

\item{drop}{whether to use the empirical range of the correlation
coefficients in the color scale, which is \emph{not} recommended (see
'Details').
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{low}{the lower color of the gradient for continuous scaling of the
correlation coefficients.
Defaults to \code{"#3B9AB2"} (blue).}

\item{mid}{the midpoint color of the gradient for continuous scaling of the
correlation coefficients.
Defaults to \code{"#EEEEEE"} (very light grey).}

\item{high}{the upper color of the gradient for continuous scaling of the
correlation coefficients.
Defaults to \code{"#F21A00"} (red).}

\item{midpoint}{the midpoint value for continuous scaling of the
correlation coefficients.
Defaults to \code{0}.}

\item{palette}{if \code{nbreaks} is used, a ColorBrewer palette to use
instead of the colors specified by \code{low}, \code{mid} and \code{high}.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{limits}{whether to bound the color scaling of the correlation
coefficients between -1 and +1.
Defaults to \code{TRUE} (recommended).}

\item{legend.position}{where to put the legend of the correlation
coefficients: see \code{\link[ggplot2]{theme}} for details.
Defaults to \code{"bottom"}.}

\item{legend.size}{the size of the legend title and labels, in points: see
\code{\link[ggplot2]{theme}} for details.
Defaults to \code{9}.}

\item{...}{other arguments supplied to \code{\link[ggplot2]{geom_text}} for
the diagonal labels.}

\description{
Function for making a correlation matrix plot, using ggplot2.
The function is directly inspired by Tian Zheng and Yu-Sung Su's
\code{\link[arm]{corrplot}} function.
Please visit \url{http://github.com/briatte/ggcorr} for the latest version
of \code{ggcorr}.
}
\details{
The \code{nbreaks} argument tries to break up the correlation
coefficients into an ordinal color scale. Recommended values for the numbers
of breaks are \code{3} to \code{11}, as values above 11 are visually
difficult to separate and are not supported by diverging ColorBrewer
palettes.

The breaks will range from \code{-1} to \code{+1}, unless \code{drop} is set
to \code{FALSE}, in which case the empirical range of the correlation
coefficients is used. The latter is not recommended, as it creates a
disbalance between the colors of negative and positive coefficients.
