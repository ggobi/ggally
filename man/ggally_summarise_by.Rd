\title{Summarize a continuous variable by each value of a discrete variable}
\usage{
ggally_summarise_by(
  data,
  mapping,
  text_fn = median_iqr,
  text_fn_vertical = NULL,
  ...
)

median_iqr(x, weights = NULL)

mean_sd(x, weights = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data set using}

\item{mapping}{aesthetics being used}

\item{text_fn}{function that takes an x and weights and returns a text string}

\item{text_fn_vertical}{function that takes an x and weights and returns a text string, used when \code{x} is discrete and \code{y} is continuous. If not provided, will use \code{text_fn}, replacing spaces by carriage returns.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed to \code{\link[ggplot2]{geom_text}(...)}}

\item{x}{a numeric vector}

\item{weights}{an optional numeric vectors of weights. If \code{NULL}, equal weights of 1 will be taken into account.}
}
\description{
Display summary statistics of a continuous variable for each value of a discrete variable.
}
\details{
\code{median_iqr} computes median and interquartile range.

\code{mean_sd} computes mean and standard deviation.
}
