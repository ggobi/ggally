Thank you for being patient with me on my submission.

I have fixed the packageVersion issue by removing the unecessary code: https://github.com/ggobi/ggally/commit/9e7228c6d4219c515857426a982d1a5c1ff0cd13

The update also contains bug fixes and new datasets.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help. Thank you again for your patience!!

Best,
Barret

Can you please change to "3.3"?

Please fix before 2023-11-21 to safely retain your package on CRAN.
