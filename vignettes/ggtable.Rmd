# `GGally::ggtable()`

The purpose of this function is to quickly plot cross-tabulated tables of discrete variables.


## Basic example

To display tables with the number of observations, simply indicate variables to present in columns and in rows.

```{r}
data(tips, package = "reshape")
ggtable(tips, "smoker", c("day", "time", "sex"))
ggtable(tips, c("smoker", "time"), c("day", "time", "sex"))
```

## Proportions

The `cells` argument allows you to control what to display. For proportions of the total, row proportions or columns proportions, simply use `"prop"`, `"row.prop"` or `"col.prop"`.

```{r}
ggtable(tips, "smoker", c("day", "time", "sex"), cells = "prop") + ggtitle("Proportions of total")
ggtable(tips, "smoker", c("day", "time", "sex"), cells = "row.prop") + ggtitle("Row proportions")
ggtable(tips, "smoker", c("day", "time", "sex"), cells = "prop") + ggtitle("Column proportions")
```

## Filling cells with residuals

Chi-square standardized residuals indicates which cells are over- or underrepresented compared to what would be expected under the independence hypothesis. If the standardized residual is less than -2, the cellâ€™s observed frequency is less than the expected frequency. Greater than 2 and the observed frequency is greater than the expected frequency. Values lower than -3 or higher than 3 indicates a strong effect.

To fill cells with standardized residuals, simply indicate `fill = "std.resid"`.

```{r}
ggtable(tips, "smoker", c("day", "time", "sex"), fill = "std.resid")
```

## Using weights

You can easily indicates weights to take into account with the **weight** aesthetic.

```{r}
d <- as.data.frame(Titanic)
ggtable(
  d,
  "Survived",
  c("Age", "Class", "Sex"),
  mapping = aes(weight = Freq),
  cells = "row.prop",
  fill = "std.resid"
)
```

## Missing with continuous variables

Although `ggtable()` is mainly intended to be used with discrete variables, you can also indicates continuous variables. In such case, some summary statistics are displayed.

```{r}
ggtable(tips, c("smoker", "total_bill"), c("day", "time", "sex", "tip"))
```
